Add your Irish housing estate hero image here.

Filename: hero.jpg (or update app/page.tsx to use hero.png etc.)

Use a licensed image, for example:
- From Glenveagh or Cairn Homes (with their permission)
- Or from a stock library (e.g. Alamy, Getty) tagged for Irish housing estate / development

The hero area uses a 4:3 aspect ratio; landscape orientation works best.
